# mdns

A standalone markdown file explorer and editor that integrates with optional productivity modules ‚Äî built for fast navigation and seamless note-taking.

## üìÑ How it Works

**mdns** (Markdown Notes Studio) is a terminal-based file manager designed specifically for text files and markdown notes. It provides a clean interface for browsing directories, previewing files, and editing with a built-in markdown editor. The real power comes from its module launcher system that lets you quickly switch between different productivity tools.
