# mdns

A standalone markdown file explorer and editor that integrates with optional productivity modules — built for fast navigation and seamless note-taking.

## 📄 How it Works

**mdns** (Markdown Notes Studio) is a terminal-based file manager designed specifically for text files and markdown notes. It provides a clean interface for browsing directories, previewing files, and editing with a built-in markdown editor. The real power comes from its module launcher system that lets you quickly switch between different productivity tools.

## 📦 Installation

Run the install script or move the Python file manually:

chmod +x mdns.py
sudo mv mdns.py /usr/local/bin/mdns
```

Optional dependencies for enhanced features:
```bash
pip install pyperclip fuzzywuzzy
```

## 🚀 Usage

Launch the file explorer:
```bash

```

Or run a specific module directly:
```bash

mdns blipt     # Launch blipt module
mdns ql        # Launch ql module
```
